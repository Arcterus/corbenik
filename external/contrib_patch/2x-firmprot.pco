# This patch was originally implemented in Luma3ds and I really
# haven't given it the testing needed.

# Credit goes to @AuroraWright, @TuxSH, and @delebile.
# According to @AuroraWright, @delebile actually came up with the patch.

# This is also identical to the safemode patch for FIRM protection
# if you're astute. Corbenik doesn't support that, though.
